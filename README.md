In this project, 1-D shock wave propagation through a condensed matter is simulated.

The shock wave can be visualized as a "tsunami" for simplicity, the state in the region ahead of the "tsunami"
front is undisturbed, and that in the region behind the "tsunami" front is changed to another equilibrium state.

A set of constitutive partial differential equations that governs this bahavior is solved numerically
to create the history of particle velocity and pressure for a point within the body. The stability of the
solution is examined using Von Neumann method.
